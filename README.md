## Rationale

Some smart people keep saying, over and over, that everyone needs some sort
of side project. As someone who is vastly inferior to these smart people, I made
a blog. I figure that this blog can be my, as I can incrementally add to it in
the midst of my (insanely busy) life. This blog was originally based on
`faceyspacey/redux-first-router-demo`, but its basis *can* change at any moment.

## Note:

This project is not actually meant to be *used*. As in, I'll probably entirely
forget about it at some point and it will fall into a world of unmaintained
sadness. And then I'll rewrite the whole thing. Also, I have absolutely no
qualifications &mdash; I'm still in high school, and have had no formal
programming training whatsoever (my school doesn't offer those sorts of
courses). So... If you decide to base *anything* off my work in this repo, be
warned: __*There be dragons!*__
